# ðŸ¥² MoodClassification

This was a deep learning project for classifying images of happy and sad people using Convulational Neural Network (CNN). 
This project was to help me learn more about tensorflow and gain a better understanding of it.

This was done by following a guide from a Youtube tutorial done by Nicholas Renotte.
